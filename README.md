## General Information
- Problem Statement
    A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


    A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Conclusions
    1. Year (Yr)- It is quite indicative that the sales have been hgher in the year 2019 hence the coefficient (0.2330) is the highest
    2. Season - This is influencer in the sales number. So during summer and winter people tend use more bike. 
                Where there is a dip in demand durng cloud or snow days
    3. Temperature- This is also a factor which influence the demand. With a unit increase in temperature the demand grows by 0.0145 units

    Its suggested to consider the non holdiday days during Summer and Winter
    because the model shows the combined factor is an influencer in growth with almost 0.1 unit growth of demand
